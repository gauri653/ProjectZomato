# ProjectZomato
This project focuses on analyzing Zomato delivery data to extract meaningful insights related to delivery performance, order times, and other key factors influencing food delivery services. The dataset is cleaned and processed to remove inconsistencies and missing values before performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Key Features
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values by dropping or imputing them.
Standardized date and time formats.
Removed unnecessary columns to optimize the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Investigated delivery times, order patterns, and customer preferences.
Analyzed factors affecting delivery performance, such as distance, weather, and order time.
Time-based Analysis:

Converted and standardized timestamps for order placement and pickup.
Derived insights on peak ordering times and delivery efficiency.
Insights from the Analysis
Order Trends: Identified peak order hours and high-demand days.
Delivery Performance: Assessed how external factors (e.g., weather, traffic) impact delivery times.
Customer Preferences: Observed patterns in food ordering behavior and delivery speed expectations.
